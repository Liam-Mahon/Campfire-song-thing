#Campfire-song-thing (I'm not great at songs)
We jump into the fire,
An unstoppable force we feel,
No one can stop our path, our desire
Into a thousand greetings, that is not real
An illusion that will shattered, unmade
Our fire is hot, it will burn the world
As we walk through hall, of sacred remains
We shall sing, clair de lune
Du Du Du Du Du Du
