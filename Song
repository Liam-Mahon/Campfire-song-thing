#Campfire-song-thing (I'm not great at songs)
We jump into the fire,
Like an unstoppable force,
Not even Cerberus can stop our path
Into a thousand greetings, that is not real
An illusion that will S-O-O-N be shattered
Our fire is hot, that will burn the world
As we walk through hall, of sacred remains
We shall sing, clair de lune
Du Du Du Du Du Du
